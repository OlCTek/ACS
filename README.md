# ACS
Artificial Control System 
This is a background voice assistant that can respond to vocal input and recognize the user. 
Things currently in the works:
1. Adding the option of text input as opposed to vocal 
2. Saving phrases in CSV files 
3. Adding nlp and using a lexer 
4. Giving the code the ability to save vocal input and learn to better understand user based on key aspects of speech
5. Facial recognition 
6. Giving the code the ability to recognize commands not explicitly coded (open all applications rather than just a few precoded ones)
7. Using Cython or transfering over to C or Java (haven't decided... right not I'm just prototyping so I'll probably use Cython until it's complete)
