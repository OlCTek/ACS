# ACS
Artificial Control System 
This is a background voice assistant that can respond to vocal input and recognize the user. 
Things currently in the works:
1. Adding the option of text input as opposed to vocal 
2. Splitting code up into modules written in C to be referenced by the main Python code
3. Updated GUI using Tkinter 
4. Implementing CSVs  
5. Adding nlp and using a lexer 
6. Giving the code the ability to save vocal input and learn to better understand user based on key aspects of speech
7. Facial recognition 
8. Giving the code the ability to recognize commands not explicitly coded (open all applications rather than just a few precoded ones)

This is far from complete and for now a bit disorganized (I have yet to go through the code to implement speed optimizing algorithms), however this should provide a basic framework for those wishing to start their own voice assistant project and from which I will be working as I move forward. The next release of the code will include comments for easier readability.
